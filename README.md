# ProjFS-SFTP

This project uses the Windows Projected File System (ProjFS) feature to project directories from an SFTP server into a local directory accessible through the regular windows explorer.

## Using & Compiling

If you want to use it, you currently have to compile it on your own with `Visual Studio 2019` and the `.NET Framework 4.7.2` installed.
To execute the program the `Windows Projected File System` feature has to be enabled (at least as long as it is in the Beta state).
